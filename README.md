# Employee Directory

This project was Project #8 as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. In this project, I created an employee directory with data pulled from the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/). I requested a JSON object from the API and used the information to assemble a grid of employee data. Flexbox was utilized to style the page and make it responsive across devices. Resetting the page will bring up new employees. Furthermore, clicking on any of the individuals will bring up a modal window showing additional details about the employee.
